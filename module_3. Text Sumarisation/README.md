# Homework 3
Text Sumarization.
__DEADLINE:  19.05.2022__
### Task
There are two major approaches to text summarization: 
 - Extractive: the model 'chooses'  which text fragment stays  and which not. 
 - Generative: the model is free to paraphrase and use different to originals words and phrases.  

You are required to implement both. 

--------------
### Requirements
We don't accept homework if any of the following requirements are not satisfied:
- The code should be situated in a public github (or gitlab) repository. Two branches: `dev` for development and `master` for the latest working version.
- All the necessary packages should be mentioned in `./requirements.txt`
- Sufficient `README.md` file:
    - Your credentials
    - "**How To**" for your repo: train model, evaluate, deploy if applicable.
    - Resources you utilized
- Your code must be fully covered with logging to `./data/log_file.log`. The file should be viewable and downloadable
- Proper `.gitignore` file. You do not want rubbish in your repo.
- **<span style="color: red;">Your model MUST BE Fully CLI - enabled. No Jupyter Notebooks allowed this time.</span>**
- I will test your application with my test txt file in CLI mode. If your cli application does not work, you will recieve a zero grade. Again. No notebooks allowed. If you are not sure how to start with CLI, `pip install fire`.  

### Dataset
We are going to use a [Kaggle Version](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/1b6883fb66c5e7f67c697c2547022cc04c9ee98c3742f9a4d6c671b4f4eda591) of ArXiv Dataset, as it is currently a stable version. It contains scientific articles with their metadata.  
The task is to generate an abstract based on the body of the document.
### Project Milestones
##### 1. Baseline Summarizer
Baseline Text summarizer based on approach, [introduced by H.P. Luhn](https://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i256/f06/papers/luhn58.pdf) in 1958 th must be implemented from scratch.  
This method is fully heuristic and does not linked to any particular dataset. Thus, it should not be a big deal for you to make the model multilingual. Let's say for English and Russian languages. Feel free to implement more. It is assumed that a document is written in only one dominant language (no multi-language documents). 
Your model must use stemming. You are allowed to use third-party libraries for it.
##### 2. Advanced Summarizer
Now you are free to use any library.

| 20     | Baseline summarizer for single language of your choice   | `foo@bar:~$ python your_module.py document.txt` must generate the file `document_abstract.txt` with a summarization. Your summarizer must contain stemming. |
| 15     | Baseline multilingual summarizer with language detection | Exactly the same as the previous one. Must support at least 2 languages. Must detect the language of the document automatically.                            |
